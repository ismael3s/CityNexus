# CityNexus

A simulated city where every system is connected.

## What is it?

CityNexus is a study project designed to explore and develop a fully integrated system for a fictional city. Using a microservices architecture, this project aims to connect different aspects of the city into a cohesive, interconnected network. Ultimately, CityNexus will showcase the complexity and flexibility of distributed systems—potentially evolving into a "distributed monolith" as we examine its scalability and maintainability.

## Why?

I created this project to document and demonstrate my technical skills, as much of my experience hasn’t been fully represented in previous projects. CityNexus allows me to explore and identify areas for improvement in a real-world-like scenario while building a digital portfolio to share on LinkedIn and strengthen my professional brand.
