# CityNexus

A simulated city where every system is connected.

## What is it?

Have you wondered how it would be if the government created a system where it can track everything you do? Well with that chaotic scenarion I started to create the CityNexus. A study project designed to explore and develop a fully integrated system for a fictional city. Using a microservices architecture, this project aims to connect different aspects of the city into a cohesive, interconnected network. Ultimately, CityNexus will showcase the complexity and flexibility of distributed systemsâ€”potentially evolving into a terrible "distributed monolith" as we examine its scalability and maintainability.

## Why?

CityNexus allows me to explore and identify areas for improvement in a real-world-like scenario while building a digital portfolio to share on LinkedIn and strengthen my professional brand.
